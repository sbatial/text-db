Simple text based (non-permanent) "database" with textual interface.

Born out of a uni excercise, boredom and curiosity.

# Usage

Compile and run with `crun`.

## Available actions

- `:h` to print help message
- `:p` to get current state of db
- `:q` to quit program
- `:x` to delete last message (equivalent: `x <amount of messages>`)
- `:x <num>` to delete message at index `<num>` (does nothing if num > amount of messages)
